    <h1>Text,Calculators and storage</h1>
<h3>Text</h3> 
<p><b>Text</b> is the content we add in our text editor. It is the important part of any programming as it contains what we are trying to do.</p>
<h3>Calculators</h3>
<p><b>Calculators</b> are compilers and enterpreters that we use to change our code to macchine language. Computers can only understand binary code therefore it is necessary to change the code we've wrriten.  </p>
<h3>Storage</h3>
<P><b>Storage</b> is the place where we store our code or data.  This is also one of the most important part of programming as it is necessary to save and store our code to update and use it. </p>
<h2>HISTORY</h2>
<p>The relationship between writers and publishers can be used to describe the concept of online development. After finalizing their novels, authors would submit them to publishing houses for printing. The book's title, subtitles, and many other details would be included in this print, which would follow a conventional or general format. This is comparable to HTML and other markup languages because they too offered our code structure and titles but not particularity. After a while, authors wanted their novels to stand out from the competition, so they began providing publishers with alternative style guides. The size or boldness of their text would be listed on this sheet. This may be connected to CSS's goal. CSS(cascading style sheets) is used by developers to give their website a unique and contrasted look.</p>
